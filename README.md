# Assignment16
This is the repo for Assignment 16 and updated Portfolio.

Here is a link to the deployed file https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment16/.


# 01 Goal:

 The Goal of this project is to update the portfolio we created in Assignment 02,and updated in Assignment 08, improve it with things we now know and reference some of our projects and assignments. Here is a link to the Github folder https://github.com/Emjayosee/Assignment16 and a link to the deployed shell https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment16/.


# 02 Approach:

    In approching this project, I took subsequent learnings and made improvements to the portfolio and added the Project One and Two and a couple of the other Assignments I completed, along with a placeholder for Project 3, coming in April 2021.


# 03 Testing and Quality Control:

    1. I have tested each link to confirm functionality.

    2. HTML Code has been formatted to make it easier to follow when viewed at source.

    3. I have loaded the files and tested the page functionality at GITHUB.

    4. I made the images a bit more responsive.

    5. Corrected typos.

    6. Added LInkeIn Link.


# 04 Lessons Learned:

The following items should be considered for future enhancements, time and budget permitting:

    1. There is not a lot of JAVASCRIPT used and I should think up ways to add some.

    2. Add actual contact details if I wish to deploy it publicly.


# 05 Further improvements to make:

    1. Incorporate social media link buttons for twitter, facebook and youtube.  Media queries have been minimized in this version of the portfolio as instructed.

    2. Add actual links to social media, linked-in and youtube (I do not use facebook) I held off on personal contact detail for future effort.
